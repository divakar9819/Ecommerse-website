<p>The about us page is another place where an ecommerce store owner can sell potential customers on both the idea or brand of the business as well as specific products. An interesting about us page helps to personalize a store and makes it stand out amongst other competitors. Store owners should be welcoming and inviting with the language used to write the page. Highlighting interesting parts of personal background as well as discussing what makes the products offered unique or of a high quality is important as well. As long as it fits into the store's brand identity, a humorous about us page is another engaging approach.</p>
